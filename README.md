# What is NetworkHandler
Network Handler is a class that helps programmers quickly make HTTP requests.

#Why NetworkHandler
It's annoying to have to define a lot of things each time I start a project that makes HTTP request. This class aims to provide a simple yet flexible interface for making HTTP requests.

#How to Use?
Install HtmlAgilityPack in your Nuget Package Manager and it's done.

#Any WiKi?
Not yet. This project is still in its very beginning stage. I will probably add it later or you can help.

#What's Next?
There are still a lot to be done: user-agents, gzip support amd etc..

#How to Contribute?
It's simple. Just create a pull request and I will review and merge.
